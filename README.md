webfont-loading-fun
===================

Asynchronously loads list of Google webfonts.

This code fetches the current list of Google webfonts via the Google Font API and displays a list of them. It then loops through them to display each font with it's own font face.

Since this is my first try in developing stuff, excuse the code. Or even better: Help me to do this better :)
